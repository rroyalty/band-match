Although she currently cannot hold a beat to save her life, she can play a mean double bass. When Toni is not coding you can usually find her outside riding her four-wheeler, or her snowmobile depending on the season, or . Toni enjoys dabbling in front and back end - she enjoys the logic and critical thinking the backend requires, but also enjoys the freedom and creativity allowed in coding on the front end. "
