She mostly enjoys the logic and planning the backend requires, but also enjoys the freedom and creativity allowed in coding on the front end. When Toni is not coding you can usually find her outside riding her four-wheeler, snowmobiling with her husband, or hiking with her dogs. Toni could at one point play a mean guitar, violin, and piano. Currently she is learning to play the drums (she can play a decent double bass, but still canâ€™t hold a beat). Feel free to get in touch, she would love to chat about music, coding, or whatever else!"
